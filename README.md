# ModernCorners

Ever had the Problem you were writing an App and using the totally trending rounded corners. But
when you released it round corners looked old and pointy corners were hip? And then you startet
using pointy corners, but then round corners were back?

With this library your app will always be trending. It uses a very complicated algorithm to determine
what style is currently in and tells you the exact corner radius to use.

You no longer need to update your app to keep up with the times.
